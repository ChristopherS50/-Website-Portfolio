   <p id ="testing">Hello! I'm Christopher Blackwell, a senior Computer Science student at Towson University.

    As I approach the completion of my Bachelor's degree in December 2024, I am eager to apply my academic learning and hands-on project experience in real-world scenarios. 
    Specializing in both backend and frontend development, I am skilled in technologies such as Java, JavaScript, Node.js, and the MERN stack. 
    My passion lies in creating seamless software solutions that enhance user experiences and solve complex problems.
    
    Throughout my time at university and in my role as a Team Member at Target, I have honed my skills in collaborative problem-solving and efficient project management. 
    I'm particularly proud of my contributions to projects like Prolink—a platform that merges features of Reddit, LinkedIn, and Pinterest to revolutionize the employment landscape—and Travel Troveia, a comprehensive travel planning tool.
    
    I am currently seeking internship opportunities where I can contribute my programming expertise and innovative thinking to a dynamic team. 
    Take a look around my website to learn more about my projects and experiences, and feel free to contact me directly to discuss how I can contribute to your team.</p>
